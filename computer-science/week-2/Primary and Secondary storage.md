## Primary and Secondary storage


**What is Primary Storage?**


- Stores short-term memory (fast)
- Memory which sits close to the CPU (it's workspace), CPU can talk to it directly 
- Holds data and instructions CPU currently working on
- RAM (Random access memory) and ROM (Read only memory) are examples


**RAM** --> Temporary workspace


- Random Access Memory
- What: Holds programs data + instructions -> being used by CPU
- Why: Assists with smoother multitasking .e.g. having multiple tabs open (more ram = smoother performance)
- How: Loads data from secondary storage to RAM --> CPU can access it directly --> processes much faster than SSD/HDD
- Volatile -> data lost when power off 


**ROM** --> Permanent starter instructions


- Read Only Memory
- What: Contains boot up instructions and BIOS
- Why: Without it, PC wouldn't know how to load OS from secondary storage
- How: Stores Data without power --> non-volatile (data isn't lost on powering off)
- Data on ROM cannot be easily overwritten (read-only)


**Virtual Memory** --> "Backup RAM"


- What: Hard disk used as extra RAM
- Why: Prevents systems crash when RAM is full
- How: OS swaps data between RAM and disk
- Slower than RAM because CPU takes longer to fetch from it


**What is secondary storage?** 


- Stores long-term storage (slow), OS, software, files permanently (non-volatile)
- Further away from CPU --> cannot be accessed directly --> has to be loaded into RAM
- Types:
- Magnetic Storage (HDD,tapes)
- Optical Storage (CD,DVD,blu-ray)
- Solid State Drive (SSD,Flash drives)
- Cloud Storage 


**Magnetic Storage**


- Stores data using magnetic fields on disks/tapes
- Cheap per GB, good for large storage,
- Read/write head moves to magnetize spots --> slower due to mechanical parts
- Very fragile moving, can break easily and heavy


**Optical Storage**


- Data --> pits (bumps) and lands (flat area) on disk surface
- if all pits --> 0, if all lands --> 0 but if lands --> pits this is 1 (vice versa)
- Depends on format, blu-ray has most (depends what its needed for)
- Easy to carry, not heavy at all
- Relability dependant on disk quality (easy to scratch/damage)


**Solid State Storage**


- Stores data in flash memory chips
- Very fast, good for OS, games and editing
- Very good storage --> 128GB - 4TB
- Uses electrical charges in transistors (0-off and 1-on)
- Easy to carry, has no moveable parts
- Expensive per GB



**Cloud Storage**


- Stores data via cloud
- Good storage --> depends on the provider
- Good for back-up, file storing which is done easily
- Speed is dependant on IPS
- Can be accessed anywhere, anytime just need a device + internet
- Has security concerns --> don't know where data is stored
- If not back-up well, can lost data
