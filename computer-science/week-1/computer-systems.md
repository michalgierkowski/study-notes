## Computer systems


What is a computer?

An electronic device that can:

- Input, allows data to enter
- Store, data can be stored at RAM or hard drive
- Processed, CPU working with data
- Output, the result (a click registered, sound played and much more)


## Von Neumann architecture:

- Keyboard / mouse (input)  --> process  --> output (a click, sound)
-                                ↓↑
-                            - storage - (RAM or hard disk)


## System architecture 

The processor "the brain" known as CPU

- CPU carries out computations
- Executes Instructions
- Processes Informations
- Contains millions of tiny transistors which are all connected with buses


**ALU** - Arithmetic logic unit

- Part of CPU
- Component where computations and logical operators occur
- Examples, addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
- Computers cannot do subraction, instead they flip number into a negative then add it e.g. (-21) + 3


**CU** - control unit "The Manager"
- Tells other components what is happening, and when to do it, and ensuring all CPU operations are in correct order
- Fetch --> next instructions and take it to CPU
- Decodes --> works out what the instruction means (what actions to take, what data to use and where to find it)
- Execute --> sends out control signals (via control bus) to other components 


**Registers** - "CPU workspace"

- Hold current data and instructions that are being worked on by CPU
- Pretty much the "CPUs Workspace"
- Provides access to data/instructions instantly 
- Due to it being built within the CPU


**Cache memory**

- Type of memory that stores accessed data/instructions (will be likely needed soon, or just been used).
- Speeds up CPU processing because its built in or very close to the CPU
- Allows CPU to grab these data much faster than other forms of storage like RAM / hard disk


**Clock** - "the heart"
- Generates series of eletrical pulses, which is a trigger signal (ticks)
- When tick occurs it allows next step of instruction to occur
- Ticks sync all CPU operators
- Ensures that they happen in the right order and at the correct time


**Clock Speed** - "the clock"

- Speed of CPU in GHz (gigahertz)
- A higher GHz = more instructions processed
- A lower GHz = less instructions processed


**Buses** - "the transport"

- The communication system for transmitting data between components

3 Types of data buses:


- Data buses --> carries data/instructions
- Address buses --> carries address of the memory location or device CPU wants to talk to
- Control buses --> carries coordaration signals generated by the Control Unit (CU)


**Cores** - mini CPU within a CPU

- Independant processing units (not a component)
- more cores = better performance
- less cores = worser performance
- Allows instructions to be processed more than 1 at a time
