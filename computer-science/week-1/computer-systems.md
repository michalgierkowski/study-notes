## Computer systems


What is a computer?

An electronic device that can:

- Input, allows data to enter
- Store, data can be stored at RAM or hard drive
- Processed, CPU working with data
- Output, the result (a click registered, sound played and much more)


Von Neumann architecture:

- Keyboard / mouse (input)  --> process  --> output (a click, sound)
-                                ↓↑
-                            - storage - (RAM or hard disk)
System architecture 

The processor "the brain" known as CPU

- CPU carries out computations
- Executes Instructions
- Processes Informations
- Contains millions of tiny transistors which are all connected with buses


ALU - Arithmetic logic unit

- Part of CPU
- Component where computations and logical operators occur
- Examples, addition, multiplication, division and subtraction.
- Computers cannot do subraction, instead they flip number into a negative then add it e.g. (-21) + 3


CU - control unit

- manages how data and instructions move around by directing the flow
- When to fetch, where to fetch and when CPU should store instead


Registers - "CPU workspace"

- Hold current data and instructions that are being processed by the CPU
- Pretty much the "CPUs Workspace"
- Provides access to data/instructions instantly than grabbing them from other storages


Cache memory

- Type of memory that stores accessed data (data that will be use, used or needed again).
- Speeds up CPU processing because its built in or close to the CPU
- Allows CPU to grab these data much faster than other forms of storage like RAM / hard disk


Clock Speed - "the clock"

- Speed of CPU in GHz (gigahertz)
- A higher GHz = more instructions processed
- A lower GHz = less instructions processed


Buses - "the transport"

- The communication system for transmitting data between components

3 Types of data buses:


- Data buses --> holds/carries data
- Address buses --> tells data buses where it's meant to go (read or write or store)
- Control buses --> controls coordaration and signals/commands between data and address bus


Cores - mini CPU within a CPU

- Independant processing units
- more cores = better performance
- less cores = worser performance
- Allows instructions to be processed more than 1 at a time
