A number system is a structured way of representing and showcasing numbers such as decimal or binary.


Types of number systems are such as Binary, Denary (decimal), Hexadecimal and Octal.

Binary:
- Base-2
- Works in a transistor (tiny switch with 2 states)
- 0 = no flow of electricity (off)
- 1 = flow of electricity allowed (on)

Why is binary used?
Binary the lowest-level language which computers understand. Anything that a computer receives such as:
- text
- images
- audio
- programs
Must be converted into binary so the processor can handle it.

Denary:
- Base-10 (0-9)
- Standard number system

Why is denary used?
Denary is used in daily usages to count, measure and perform calculations such as:
- count how many items in shopping cart
- measure how tall a building needs to be
This allows humans to have a easier interaction with computers.

Hexadecimal:
- 16-base (0-9 , A-F (10-15))

Why is Hexadecimal used?
Hexadecimal is used to make large binary numbers representable.
