A number system is a structured way of representing and showcasing numbers such as decimal or binary.
Types of number systems are such as Binary, Denary (decimal), Hexadecimal and Octal.

## Binary:
- Base-2
- Works in a transistor (tiny switch with 2 states)
- 0 = no flow of electricity (off)
- 1 = flow of electricity allowed (on)

Why is binary used?
Binary the lowest-level language which computers understand. Anything that a computer receives such as:
- text
- images
- audio
- programs
Must be converted into binary so the processor can understand and handle it.

## Denary:
- Base-10 (0-9)
- Standard number system (What us humans use daily)
- Counting from right to left when assigning positions

Why is denary used?
Denary is used in daily usages to count, measure and perform calculations such as:
- count how many items in shopping cart
- measure how tall a building needs to be
This allows humans to have a easier interaction with computers.

## Hexadecimal:
- 16-base (0-9 , A-F (10-15))
- Counting from right to left when assigning positions

Why is Hexadecimal used?
Hexadecimal is used to make large binary numbers representable. 
Examples of these can be found in:
- IP Address (IPv4)
- Web Design (Colour codes)
- Memory addresses
This allows notations to be more "human-friendly"

## Octal:
- 8-base
- Calcuation = Digit X 8 ^ position
- Counting from right to left when assigning positions
- Not used as often anymore (Hexadecimal is the preferred)

Why is Octal used?
- A simpler way to read and write binary.
- In Unix/Linux errors/permissions

## Importance of number systems in computing:
- Are the foundation for storing, processing and outputting information. 
- Computers use 0 and 1 at hardware level this known as binary (Machine code)
- Other number systems (Denary, Hexadecimal and Octal) are human-friendly allowing us to interact with machine more easily
