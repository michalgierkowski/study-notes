# The Need for operating system

**What is a operating system?**


(OS is the "manager/boss" of the PC)
A system software which allows the user to interact with computing components, known as hardware, via a user-friendly interface (UI). While handling many process such as, files, device and memory. 


**What does operating system include?**


- File managment --> How the OS organizes, stores, retrives and controls access to files on HDD,SSD.
- Device Driver --> Enables communcation between the OS and hardware so they can understand each other (acts like "translator").
- User interface --> allows user (us) to interact with systems through a UI.
- Memory managment --> Manages RAM and allocates memory to applications (keeps them balanced).
- User --> The person who interacts with the computer (we are the input)
- Application software --> type of program designed to help users with their tasks, for example word.
- Utility programs --> to maintain, protect and optimize computer (like defragmentation).


**Resource managment/Multi-tasking**


- Multitasking is the process of having more than one program open and running.
- Switches between programs incredibly fast, to us it seems like they are running at the same time.
- OS allocates CPU time to process/cycle, once that CPU time has expired, the next process/cycle occurs.
- Uses a queue (type of data structure), first in first out, this is continued throughout and seems they are running at the same time. 


**File managment**


- Uses extenstions
- Which tells the OS which application to load file into.
- Some of these include:
- JPEG - images
- PNG - images
- MP4 - videos + audio
- MP3 - audio
- DOC - document
- PDF - document text


**User managment/security**


- Usermanagment --> allows multiple users to log onto same computer.
- Saves preference (settings, icons, desktops) for each user.
- Each user has a different "access level" to certain programs.
- A admin account, would have "root" access.
- While a student would be have limitations to access. 


**Example of OS Process**
1. User opens discord --> request to OS
2. OS file managment --> finds discord program files
3. Storage driver --> uses storage driver to communicate to hardware
4. CPU fetch --> tells CPU to fetch these files
5. RAM load --> CPU copies instructions into RAM
6. Process begins --> CPU is extracting discord from RAM
7. OS is multitasking constantly, ensuring all programs have balanced CPU times, devices managed by correct drivers, constantly checking if discord has enough RAM? If not then has to "talk" to virtual memory
