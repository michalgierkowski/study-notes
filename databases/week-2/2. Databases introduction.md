# What is a database?

A database is a structured and organized collection of data, which allows for easier actions such as:
- Adding - (if you wanted to add new record)
- Modifying/Editing - (existing records)
- Deleting - (removing records we don't need)
- Searching - (certain information found quickly and accurately)

**Electronic databases**

Pros:
- Allows backup copies (incase something occurs)
- Easy to access, just need a device
- Multiple users can access it at the same time (no waiting times)
- Searching for information is very easy

**What is a relationship?**
A relationship is the link of common data between one or more tables


**Flat file database (has no relationships)**
Pros:

- Easy to setup and simple to understand
- A single table of with information stored (with columns, rows and cells)
- Has more than one category
- Good for small applications (like logging and simple stuff)

Cons:

- Duplicates occur often
- Hard to update (you may have to update it all, instead of one area)
- Performance decreases as file size increases (larger files)
- Bad for larger applications
- Less secure when scaling

What is it better for? (examples)
- After-school football club, keeping information on who turns up at what days
- Accountant for start-up company


**Relational databases (has relationships)**
Pros:

- Reduces duplicates
- Easy to update (you can change one place/area)
- Good for larger applications
- More reliable and consistent data
- More secure when scaling

Cons:

- Way more complicated to setup and harder to understand (involves keys, relationships)
- Slower for simpler tasks (like logging and simple stuff)
- Requires more knowledge to maintain

What is it better for? (examples)
- School-wide timetable, multiple students, teachers and subjects
- Banks, keeping account details, customers information


**Types of keys**
- Primary key --> the unique identifer in their own table (like a student ID)
- Foreign key --> points to primary key used in a different table (table 1 (primary) has student ID, table 2 also has student ID this points to table 1)
- Seconday key --> Primary key "downgrade" -> a field that can be searched and easily found (like searching by a name, not date)


**Types of relationships**
- One to one: one record to one, an example --> citizen (one) with a passport (one)
- One to many: one record to many, any example --> a doctor (one) and their patients (many)
- Many to many: many records to many, an example --> football clubs (many) with players (many)
