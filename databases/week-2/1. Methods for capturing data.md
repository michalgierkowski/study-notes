 # Data Methods

 
 Capturing data is the process of raw data being collected, then entering them into a computer system
 This can be done either manually or automatically, some of the main methods are:

**Manual input devices** 
 
 - Devices we need to interact with to enter data, examples -> touchscreens, mouses and keyboards

**Direct data capture**  

- Devices that can automatically read data (without us entering it), examples -> barcode scanners (like at stores), QR code readers

**Sensors devices (automatic)**

- Devices that can measure change in the environment, examples -> apple watch, temperature sensors

**Biometric devices (automatic)**

- Devices that capture unique human features, examples -> fingerprints scanners, iris scanner, face recognition

**Audio/Visual input (automatic)**

- Devices that capture sounds or images, examples -> microphone, webcams 


**For data to be processed it has to go through a cycle**

The cycle insits of:

- Capturing --> ensuring raw data is entered into computer systems
- Selecting --> filtering out unnecessary data, keep the relevant data (we use SQL to help us - Structured Query Language)
- Manging --> manipulating data by: adding, editing and deleting data, in other words organizing data so its easier to use
- Exchanging --> sharing data with others, such as reports or sending it to other systems
